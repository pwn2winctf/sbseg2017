ButcherCorp has developed an extremely reliable radiation-hardened IC packaging process. Its only drawback is requiring the ASIC to be fabricated using a specific 0.35Î¼m technology, considered outdated by today's standards. The intel we gathered suggests that their standard cell library is based on osu035.

One of our operatives managed to exfiltrate a GDSII file ButcherCorp has sent to a silicon fab. Apparently, it is the IC responsible for validating the launching code in their latest rocket engine.

The IC samples the in `pin` at the `clock`'s positive edge. If the correct sequence of bits is presented to the IC, it drives the `unlocked` pin to a high logical level. Find this sequence. It forms an ASCII string which you should submit as a flag.
