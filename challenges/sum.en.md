This problem is an example on how to connect to our server to read inputs and send the outputs for the programming challenges. Given a set of numbers greater than zero, followed by zero and a line break, compute the sum of these numbers.  All you need to do in order to obtain the flag is to execute the implementation you see more fit!

The solution for this problem is available bellow:
